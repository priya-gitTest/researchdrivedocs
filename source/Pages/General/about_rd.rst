About ResearchDrive
*******************

ResearchDrive is a service that allows researchers to store and share their research data with anyone in the world. ResearchDrive is based on the [Owncloud](https://owncloud.com) software. The storage system used is [SURFsara's Object Store](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/object-store/index.html).

ResearchDrive can be accessed using the web interface at: [https://researchdrive.surfsara.nl](https://researchdrive.surfsara.nl). It can be accessed using WebDAV, which enables you to use tools like Cyberduck, curl and others to access your data. WebDAV can also be used to couple ResearchDrive to other services supporting WebDAV.
